# pc-gamelist-doc

**Index of the PC and portable-C game documentation** — 17 titles, one
repository each. This family has no shared platform checklist: a DOS game from
1987 and a PhyreEngine remaster from 2018 have almost nothing in common except
the machine they end up on, which is exactly why the index is per platform and
not per engine.

Two strands run through it. The first is DOS-era format archaeology — containers,
sprite codecs, map formats and the editor work files that shipped by accident.
The second is modern remasters and PC ports, where the interesting layer is the
older console the build is still pretending to be. No repository here contains
game assets or executables — only measurements and the code to reproduce them.

## The titles

Listed in the order they were documented. The **Saga** column is filled in where
the title belongs to a series that may one day earn its own index; it is empty
where it does not. Three of them — Final Fantasy twice, and Mana — already point
at a Square Enix cluster that is one title away from deserving its own repo.
**HeroQuest** is a saga of two, and its other half is on a different machine
entirely: *HeroQuest II: Legacy of Sorasil* sits in the CD32 list as
[cd32-heroquest2-doc](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/cd32-heroquest2-doc). Two
titles across two families is not yet an index of its own.

## The write-ups

Each entry below is the write-up that used to sit in the
*Game and engine documentation* table of the [profile
README](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev), moved here **verbatim**. Nothing was
rewritten or summarised in the move: same prose, same numbers, same links. The
only change is that a `\|` written to escape a pipe inside a table cell is now
a plain `|`, because these are no longer table cells.

### [Wacky Wheels](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-wackywheels-doc)

*Wacky Wheels* (Apogee, 1994) and its fixed-point pseudo-3D floor renderer

### [Battle Bugs](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-battlebugs-doc)

*Battle Bugs* (Sierra/Epyx, 1994) — 800×600 in 16 planar colours, one asset set serving both modes, and a per-bitplane column-major image codec

### [Corridor 7: Alien Invasion](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-corridor7-doc)

*Corridor 7: Alien Invasion* (Capstone / IntraCorp, 1994) — a licensed **Wolfenstein 3-D** taken to 256 colours, shipping its levels in TED5's `TED5v1.0` **editor work file** with the map directory linked into the EXE. The MUSE tags date the whole soundtrack to the day, and ten credit sprites hang along a corridor on level 1

### [H.U.R.L. / Slob Zone 3D](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-hurl-doc)

*H.U.R.L.* / *Slob Zone 3D* (Deep River Publishing, 1995) on Lary Myers' **ACK-3D**. Levels ship as commented ASCII naming 661 of the game's 684 bitmaps by their original artist file names, and every projectile sits in a sealed room off the edge of the map because the engine allocates nothing at run time. The retail build still holds a level-select switch and an objective system never enabled

### [Might & Magic: Secret of the Inner Sanctum](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-mm-doc)

*Might & Magic: Secret of the Inner Sanctum* (1987)

### [Sargon V: World Class Chess](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-sargon5-doc)

*Sargon V: World Class Chess* (Mediagenic, 1991) — five files with four different extensions turn out to be **one container**, whose LZW packs **least-significant bit first**. One 8-bit asset set drives all four displays, the tutorial lessons are 258-node decision trees whose authoring sources shipped by mistake, and the About box hides a hamster

### [Nitemare-3D: A House of Horrors](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-nitemare3d-doc)

*Nitemare-3D: A House of Horrors* (David P. Gray, 1994) — a one-man 256-colour shooter that owes **nothing** to Wolfenstein: every format is Gray's own and none of it is compressed, because the engine demand-pages its art through a three-tier RAM/XMS/disk cache. An artist's placeholder shipped in the retail data as a wall reading *"See file TILES007.PCX"*

### [GRANDIA HD Remaster](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-grandiahd-doc)

*GRANDIA HD Remaster* — the PSX GPU/SPU/CD libraries reimplemented on D3D11/XAudio2

### [Secret of Mana (PC remake)](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-secretofmana-doc)

*Secret of Mana* (2018 PC remake), a PhyreEngine title

### [FINAL FANTASY V (PC)](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-ff5-doc)

*FINAL FANTASY V* (2015 PC) and the mobile-port fingerprints in the build

### [FINAL FANTASY TYPE-0 HD](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-fftype0-doc)

*FINAL FANTASY TYPE-0 HD* — PSP heritage and the HexaDrive render layer

### [Infinite Undiscovery](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-infiniteundiscovery)

*Infinite Undiscovery* (tri-Ace, Xbox 360) and the ASKA engine

### [HeroQuest](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-heroquest-doc)

*HeroQuest* (Gremlin Graphics, 1991–92) — the licensed board game on three DOS floppies, documented from somebody's installed directory zipped up in 2008. All three executables are **EXEPACK**-packed by the same linker flag and only one of them, `QUEST.EXE`, carries a **1980-01-06 19:48:46** timestamp, which exonerates the packer and hands the CD32 checklist's long-standing "sixth epoch" question its first DOS sample. The twenty-four quest files each open with a 26 × 19 byte grid, and because every square is either zero or one fixed region id, the union of all twenty-four **reconstructs the entire board**: 42 regions, 494 squares, zero unassigned, one square where the quests disagree. Accented letters are remapped onto the **lower-case ASCII row** — `a` = Ä, `e` = È, `n` = Ñ, `u` = Ü — because the 87-glyph font has no lower case to displace, which is a different answer from the CD32 sequel's `( ) * +` and for a reason visible in the two fonts. The interface is in five languages and the quest prose is in English only. The copyright notice is **plain text** here and pixels-only on CD32, so that finding was never a house policy; Imagitec supplied the audio to both games and is credited on screen here and hidden in a linked binary there. And the tempting 1.945 ratio between all the VGA and all the EGA art collapses to **1.123** once the ten VGA-only intro pictures are excluded — the number was measuring the intro, not the colour depth

### [Baron Baldric: A Grave Adventure](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-baronbaldric-doc)

*Baron Baldric: A Grave Adventure* (CTV-Link / Manaccom, 1992–93) — an Australian DOS platformer surviving as somebody's installed `C:\BARON` directory: thirteen files, 2,036,866 bytes, and **every single date forty-eight years in the future**. Twelve files are stamped 2040–41 and one is stamped 2050, all of them legal values in the seven-bit MS-DOS year field; subtracting 48 puts the build at **1992-11-29 → 1993-02-07**, and the number is pinned not by the dates but by two strings — a Borland runtime copyright reading `1983,92`, which forbids anything earlier, and the game's own banner reading `(ver 1.0  Nov 1992)`. The lone 2050 outlier looked like noise and turned out to be **the only file that can distinguish an addition from a stuck bit**, because 12 and 13 share no bits with 48 and 22 does. The three `.BNK` containers have **no directory whatsoever**: a five-byte `-ID-` marker precedes every member and the chain *is* the index, which makes the walk self-proving — eighty-eight members, three walks, all three landing exactly on the file length. Inside one of them sits `BALDRIC.MAP`, which is not a level but **the Turbo Pascal linker's own map file, packed into the shipping game by a build script that globbed for `*.MAP`**: it names seven `.PAS` sources, 178 public symbols and the entire global state (`ENERGY`, `LIVES`, `FLINTS`, `TREASURE`, `LIGHTREMAINING`), and because Pascal lays globals out consecutively, the gap between one symbol and the next yields **thirty animations with their frame counts** — `AWALKL` 8, `ADIE` 8, and `AFART`, `APICKNOSE` and `ASCRATCHBALLS` for the idle loop. Its `LEV` variable is 3,516 bytes and every level file is 3,520 with a four-byte header; its `DIGITS` is 640 and `DIGIT.FNT` is 640. It also describes a build **half the size of the one that shipped**, twenty-six days earlier. Nothing is packed, the 4,096-byte launcher sets `e_maxalloc == e_minalloc` so it can `EXEC` the game (which is what the underscore in `_BALDRIC.EXE` is for), the 165-frame sprite codec encodes against a **256-byte row pitch unrelated to the frames' declared widths**, ten of the eleven levels ship a compiled 8086 trigger table whose 255 case labels all fall inside the 3,500-cell grid, and one audio member turns out to be **twelve complete Creative VOC files concatenated head to tail**. Two extension collisions are closed by measurement (`.BNK` is not an AdLib bank, `.HSC` is not an HSC-Tracker module) — and the eleven members that genuinely hold FM music open with a magic, `AmBk`, that remains unidentified
