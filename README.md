# pc-gamelist-doc

**Index of the PC and portable-C game documentation** — 19 titles, one
repository each. This family has no shared platform checklist: a DOS game from
1987 and a PhyreEngine remaster from 2018 have almost nothing in common except
the machine they end up on, which is exactly why the index is per platform and
not per engine.

Two strands run through it. The first is format archaeology from the DOS and
early-Windows era — containers, sprite codecs, map formats and the editor work
files that shipped by accident.
The second is modern remasters and PC ports, where the interesting layer is the
older console the build is still pretending to be. No repository here contains
game assets or executables — only measurements and the code to reproduce them.

## The titles

Listed in the order they were documented. The **Saga** column is filled in where
the title belongs to a series that may one day earn its own index; it is empty
where it does not. Three of them — Final Fantasy twice, and Mana — already point
at a Square Enix cluster that is one title away from deserving its own repo.
**HeroQuest** is a saga of two, and its other half is on a different machine
entirely: *HeroQuest II: Legacy of Sorasil* sits in the CD32 list as
[cd32-heroquest2-doc](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/cd32-heroquest2-doc). Two
titles across two families is not yet an index of its own.
**Baron Baldric** is the second saga of two, and the mirror image of that
arrangement: both halves are on this machine and in this list, *Baron Baldric:
A Grave Adventure* and its sequel *Mystic Towers*. Its Saga cell was empty
until the sequel arrived, because a saga of one is not a saga; two titles in
one family is a column entry and still not an index of its own. What the two
have in common turns out to be a protagonist, a Borland runtime and three
asset files — different studio, different publisher, different engine, and a
different machine underneath.

## The write-ups

Each entry below is the write-up that used to sit in the
*Game and engine documentation* table of the [profile
README](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev), moved here **verbatim**. Nothing was
rewritten or summarised in the move: same prose, same numbers, same links. The
only change is that a `\|` written to escape a pipe inside a table cell is now
a plain `|`, because these are no longer table cells.

### [Battle Bugs](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-battlebugs-doc)

*Battle Bugs* (Sierra/Epyx, 1994) — 800×600 in 16 planar colours, one asset set serving both modes, and a per-bitplane column-major image codec

### [Corridor 7: Alien Invasion](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-corridor7-doc)

*Corridor 7: Alien Invasion* (Capstone / IntraCorp, 1994) — a licensed **Wolfenstein 3-D** taken to 256 colours, shipping its levels in TED5's `TED5v1.0` **editor work file** with the map directory linked into the EXE. The MUSE tags date the whole soundtrack to the day, and ten credit sprites hang along a corridor on level 1

### [H.U.R.L. / Slob Zone 3D](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-hurl-doc)

*H.U.R.L.* / *Slob Zone 3D* (Deep River Publishing, 1995) on Lary Myers' **ACK-3D**. Levels ship as commented ASCII naming 661 of the game's 684 bitmaps by their original artist file names, and every projectile sits in a sealed room off the edge of the map because the engine allocates nothing at run time. The retail build still holds a level-select switch and an objective system never enabled

### [Might & Magic: Secret of the Inner Sanctum](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-mm-doc)

*Might & Magic: Secret of the Inner Sanctum* (1987)

### [Sargon V: World Class Chess](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-sargon5-doc)

*Sargon V: World Class Chess* (Mediagenic, 1991) — five files with four different extensions turn out to be **one container**, whose LZW packs **least-significant bit first**. One 8-bit asset set drives all four displays, the tutorial lessons are 258-node decision trees whose authoring sources shipped by mistake, and the About box hides a hamster

### [Nitemare-3D: A House of Horrors](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-nitemare3d-doc)

*Nitemare-3D: A House of Horrors* (David P. Gray, 1994) — a one-man 256-colour shooter that owes **nothing** to Wolfenstein: every format is Gray's own and none of it is compressed, because the engine demand-pages its art through a three-tier RAM/XMS/disk cache. An artist's placeholder shipped in the retail data as a wall reading *"See file TILES007.PCX"*

### [GRANDIA HD Remaster](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-grandiahd-doc)

*GRANDIA HD Remaster* — the PSX GPU/SPU/CD libraries reimplemented on D3D11/XAudio2

### [Infinite Undiscovery](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-infiniteundiscovery)

*Infinite Undiscovery* (tri-Ace, Xbox 360) and the ASKA engine

### [HeroQuest](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-heroquest-doc)

*HeroQuest* (Gremlin Graphics, 1991–92) — the licensed board game on three DOS floppies, documented from somebody's installed directory zipped up in 2008. All three executables are **EXEPACK**-packed by the same linker flag and only one of them, `QUEST.EXE`, carries a **1980-01-06 19:48:46** timestamp, which exonerates the packer and hands the CD32 checklist's long-standing "sixth epoch" question its first DOS sample. The twenty-four quest files each open with a 26 × 19 byte grid, and because every square is either zero or one fixed region id, the union of all twenty-four **reconstructs the entire board**: 42 regions, 494 squares, zero unassigned, one square where the quests disagree. Accented letters are remapped onto the **lower-case ASCII row** — `a` = Ä, `e` = È, `n` = Ñ, `u` = Ü — because the 87-glyph font has no lower case to displace, which is a different answer from the CD32 sequel's `( ) * +` and for a reason visible in the two fonts. The interface is in five languages and the quest prose is in English only. The copyright notice is **plain text** here and pixels-only on CD32, so that finding was never a house policy; Imagitec supplied the audio to both games and is credited on screen here and hidden in a linked binary there. And the tempting 1.945 ratio between all the VGA and all the EGA art collapses to **1.123** once the ten VGA-only intro pictures are excluded — the number was measuring the intro, not the colour depth

### [Baron Baldric: A Grave Adventure](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-baronbaldric-doc)

*Baron Baldric: A Grave Adventure* (CTV-Link / Manaccom, 1992–93) — an Australian DOS platformer surviving as somebody's installed `C:\BARON` directory: thirteen files, 2,036,866 bytes, and **every single date forty-eight years in the future**. Twelve files are stamped 2040–41 and one is stamped 2050, all of them legal values in the seven-bit MS-DOS year field; subtracting 48 puts the build at **1992-11-29 → 1993-02-07**, and the number is pinned not by the dates but by two strings — a Borland runtime copyright reading `1983,92`, which forbids anything earlier, and the game's own banner reading `(ver 1.0  Nov 1992)`. The lone 2050 outlier looked like noise and turned out to be **the only file that can distinguish an addition from a stuck bit**, because 12 and 13 share no bits with 48 and 22 does. The three `.BNK` containers have **no directory whatsoever**: a five-byte `-ID-` marker precedes every member and the chain *is* the index, which makes the walk self-proving — eighty-eight members, three walks, all three landing exactly on the file length. Inside one of them sits `BALDRIC.MAP`, which is not a level but **the Turbo Pascal linker's own map file, packed into the shipping game by a build script that globbed for `*.MAP`**: it names seven `.PAS` sources, 178 public symbols and the entire global state (`ENERGY`, `LIVES`, `FLINTS`, `TREASURE`, `LIGHTREMAINING`), and because Pascal lays globals out consecutively, the gap between one symbol and the next yields **thirty animations with their frame counts** — `AWALKL` 8, `ADIE` 8, and `AFART`, `APICKNOSE` and `ASCRATCHBALLS` for the idle loop. Its `LEV` variable is 3,516 bytes and every level file is 3,520 with a four-byte header; its `DIGITS` is 640 and `DIGIT.FNT` is 640. It also describes a build **half the size of the one that shipped**, twenty-six days earlier. Nothing is packed, the 4,096-byte launcher sets `e_maxalloc == e_minalloc` so it can `EXEC` the game (which is what the underscore in `_BALDRIC.EXE` is for), the 165-frame sprite codec encodes against a **256-byte row pitch unrelated to the frames' declared widths**, ten of the eleven levels ship a compiled 8086 trigger table whose 255 case labels all fall inside the 3,500-cell grid, and one audio member turns out to be **twelve complete Creative VOC files concatenated head to tail**. Two extension collisions are closed by measurement (`.BNK` is not an AdLib bank, `.HSC` is not an HSC-Tracker module) — and the eleven members that genuinely hold FM music open with a magic, `AmBk`, that remains unidentified

> *Added after the fact, because the write-ups above are otherwise reproduced
> verbatim and this one ends on a claim that is no longer true:* `AmBk` **has
> since been identified** as the AMOS memory-bank magic, from the sequel below.

### [Mystic Towers](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-mystictowers-doc)

*Mystic Towers* (Animation FX / Apogee, 1994) — *A Baron Baldric Adventure*,
and the sequel turns out to share a protagonist, a Borland runtime and three
asset files with its predecessor and **nothing else at all**. Forty-six members
of its single 3.4 MB container open with `AmBk` and ten with `AmSp`: these are
**AMOS memory banks and AMOS sprite banks**, and all fifty-six parse to
completion — 46 of 46 once the top bit of the length long is read as AMOS's
chip-memory flag and the length is counted from offset 12, and 10 of 10 sprite
banks closing on their frame chain plus a 64-byte palette. Every one of the 231
frames is five bitplanes deep and a whole number of **16-pixel words** wide,
the palettes are 32 entries of Amiga `$0RGB` with no bit above bit 11, the
eight music members are ProTracker `M.K.` modules and 90 of 93 digitised
samples are **signed**. The credits, XOR'd with 0x55 inside a container member,
say it in words: *Amiga Programming — Steve Hovelroud / PC conversion — Darren
Baker*. That identifies the `AmBk` magic
[pc-baronbaldric-doc](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-baronbaldric-doc) left
unidentified, and answers its question about why a little-endian shop wrote
big-endian words — here the seam is visible **inside single structs**: the AMOS
sprite header and the DOS one are the same five fields in opposite byte orders
for the same artwork, and a sound entry carries a big-endian sample rate four
bytes in front of a little-endian length. Ten AMOS sprite banks shipped in the
retail data **by accident**, 170,520 bytes and 231 frames the DOS game cannot
open, nine of the ten matching their converted twin's frame count exactly — the
same class of mistake as the linker map that shipped inside the previous game,
ten times larger and at a different studio. Elsewhere: the ZIP's seven
identical 1996 timestamps are a **TorrentZip constant**, proved by recomputing
`CRC32` of the archive's own 448-byte central directory and getting the
`3E1FE61E` in the comment; the only surviving real date is the ISO 9660 volume
descriptor's **1994-07-26 11:03:34**, under which the mastering tool had
already flattened all 307 file records to one second; the disc labelled as the
game's CD edition is a **German CDV Software shareware compilation**, 60 % of
it two promotional slideshows, and the "installed" folder beside it is a
byte-identical copy of one directory off it; `MT-HELP.EXE` has **no MZ header
at all**, so it is a `.COM` image that turns out to be an Apogee help text run
through TXT2COM and then PKLITE; and the predecessor's sprite codec's signature
256-byte row pitch holds on **0 of 2,002** frames here, because this codec
restarts at every scanline


### [Zero Comico](https://github.com/vs-sr-dev/pc-zerocomico-doc)

*Zero Comico* (GMM Entertainment / Medusa Games, 2001) — an Italian
television tie-in for the comedy trio Aldo, Giovanni e Giacomo, documented
twice: from a 506,378,240-byte **WinISO image made in 2003** and from the
**pressed CD**. All 2,862 files hash identically between them and **every one
of the 2,862 recorded timestamps differs**, because the converter discarded
660 real dates and wrote eleven values, three of which are not dates at all
(month 230, day 0, hour 192) — so the image's `WinISO software` publisher,
its 2003 creation date, its ISO 9660 violations and its **four duplicate
paths** are artefacts of the copy, while the original reads
`NERO___BURNING_ROM`, `2001-10-08 15:00:00` at **GMT+2**, and is conformant.
The real dates then agree with the PE linker timestamps **to within one
second** and date the build to the afternoon of 28 September 2001, on which
**2,191 of 2,862 files** were re-exported. **69.49 % of the disc is thirteen
minutes and forty-nine seconds of video**: seven Indeo 5 files at 320×240
averaging 3,370 kbit/s, six of them encoded with *every frame a keyframe* —
9,539 video chunks and 9,539 keyframe flags in `intro.avi` alone — and the
seventh, encoded four days later at 23:08, with sixteen in 1,206. The seven
are **2.86 times the size of the entire game**, and 7.22 % of the disc is
uncompressed PCM inside them on a CD that also ships 558 MP3s and an MP3
decoder. 2,188 files sit inside two in-house containers, `JFX1` and `JGF5`,
both wrapping an **LZHUF** stream — Okumura 1989, LZSS under an *adaptive*
Huffman coder, which is why 503 documented attempts against it failed — and
all 2,188 decode to their exact declared length, turning 72.8 MB into
**214.4 MB**. Nothing on the disc is what its extension says: the 1,433
`.tga` are not Targa (**0 of 1,433** pass the header arithmetic, they are
32-bit `JGF5`, 96.4 % power-of-two), the 25 `.flc` are not FLIC, and the 82
`.bsp` are plain CRLF text holding a verified **two-dimensional** BSP over
the walkable floor — the preorder walk closes on all 80, N internal nodes and
exactly N+1 nulls, over 1,948 convex cells and a 53,518-arc pathfinding graph
with **exactly one node per room-outline vertex**. The engine is not this
game's: `Lucifer 3D Interface`, source headers from **1998-08-20**, four
hard-coded paths including `d:\motore\japotek3d.dll`, a DirectPlay lobby,
twelve directional hit-reaction slots, `obj_spada`, `combat.mp3` and the
title string **`Silver Raven On-line`** — and the three protagonists joke,
across three chapters, that the studio never made them a fighting animation,
which the executable's own symbol table confirms. The retail executable's
version resource reads `Playable Demo`, version **`0.8.0.0`**,
`OriginalFilename: game_engine.exe`, `Copyright © 1999 GMM Entertainment
S.r.l.`, naming a developer that appears nowhere on the packaging or in the
readme. Elsewhere: **400 lines of the shipped scripts are 56-byte runs of
`0xCD`**, the Microsoft C runtime's *debug-build* fill for uninitialised
heap, and they are all 400 of the game's `sound:` lines, none of them valid;
3.2 MB of English MSI transform ships registered and unreachable because
`EnableLangDlg=N`; twenty-three script files are signed
`//Puzzle Files Created by Game Editor by PietruZ&DariuZ`, the only place on
the disc where a person who made this game is named; and the 49,163
characters of dialogue hold Monkey Island's **insult sword-fighting** with 65
hand-written lines across five opponents, a plumber whose **surname is
Mario** and whose brother Gigi lives upstairs, and Pac-Man introducing
himself under his 1980 Japanese trade name, **`Puck Man`**
